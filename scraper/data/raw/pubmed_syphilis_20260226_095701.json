To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of MG resolving with concurrent treatment of neurosyphilis. Our patient was a 67-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a diffuse rash, bilateral ptosis, bilateral facial weakness, and bulbar symptoms (dysarthria, difficulty with mastication, and difficulty drinking flui...",

First described by Jean-Martin Charcot, this condition was initially recognized as a manifestation of syphilitic infection. With the advent of antibiotics, the incidence of syphilis declined; however, it has since re-emerged in regions including Europe, North America, and China. In recent years, there has been a relative paucity of...",
