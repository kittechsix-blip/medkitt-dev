      "abstract": "Chest pain is a common complaint in children and adolescents. The causes of chest pain are varied and include musculoskeletal, pulmonary or pleural, gastrointestinal, psychogenic, and cardiac etiologies. The etiology of pediatric chest pain is often benign but typically generates evaluation in the emergency room, urgent care, or outpatient setting. Diagnostic imaging is often used in the evaluation of pediatric chest pain. This document will discuss various clinical scenarios for children presen...",

However, management becomes complex when PE occurs concurrently with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), where anticoagulation may worsen bleeding. A 74-year-old male patient presented after syncope and traumatic head injury. He was hypoxic and tachycardic on arrival with concern for right ventricular strain. Given persistent clinical concern, CT angiography of the chest demonstrated a ...",

Antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) activate platelets and lead to a hypercoagulable state, causing thrombotic complications, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Given the widespread use of prophylactic heparin in clinical practice, prompt recognition and management are crucial due to the associated high morbidi...",
