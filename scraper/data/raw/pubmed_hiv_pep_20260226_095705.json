      "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection poses a significant occupational risk to healthcare workers (HCWs), particularly in high-endemic settings like Ghana. Despite the availability of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), adherence remains suboptimal due to systemic and individual-level barriers. This study explored the experiences of HCWs in managing HBV PEP following occupational exposures. An exploratory qualitative design was employed at a Military Hospital in Accra. Data were collected through 5 foc...",
