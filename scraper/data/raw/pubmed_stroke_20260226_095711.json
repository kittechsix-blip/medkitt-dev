      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of neurointerventional therapy plus intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis involving 120 AIS patients admitted to our hospital from January 2023 to December 2024. Based on their treatment plans, patients were categorized into an alteplase group (<i>n</i> = 55) and a combination group (<i>n</i> = 65). In both groups, all patients received standard intravenous thromb...",

Alteplase has long been the standard thrombolytic therapy for AIS, though tenecteplase has recently gained attention due to its favorable pharmacokinetics and simplified administration. Despite its increasing clinical use and recent FDA approval for AIS, safety data, particularly regarding bleeding outcomes, remain limited. The objective was to compare the incidence of symptoma...",
